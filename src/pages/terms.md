# Terms of use agreement 
Revised on: May 18, 2024 

## Section 1: Contributions 

TTNRT provides many ways to help improve our services, websites, or any other creation we do. For context, TTNRT hosts most of its website data to TTGit, rather than our GitHub. However, if the data is at risk, the repository the code is hosted on will have to be private. In other words, any actions to push or pull our repos will become imposable. 

## Section 2: Accounts 

TTNRT has the right to remove accounts from our servers, whenever it’s an account violation, or account deletion. TTNRT also has access to your account, regardless of the security you set up. However, all accounts receive emails regarding their account on an activation notice, account deletion, terms of use violation, etc. Some other uses for checking may include the use monitoring of users, profile issues, etc. 

Staff that have such accounts are also subjected to high accounts of monitoring on certain devices, except for the consumer or customer that uses MyTT. Services that have an account portal may have a removal tool for their account as well. This, however, may be changed in the future with the addition of LDAP and OAuth authorization. 

## Section 3: Violations 

TTNRT wants to keep a safe environment for all users and staff. However, this can change for that specific user if one is breaking our rules. We have 5 of them, some not in place for some platforms, but soon they will be added to the system. 

- All Good - You have no active violations in effect for all services and subscriptions you purchased on your account are safe. 

- Warning and limited access. - You have 1 account violation on your account. This means you get a warning and limited access to certain services. 

- 2 violations - You will have restricted account access to services and subscriptions. This can include the following: domain management, TTGit, Mastodon, TTPages, and TTHost. 

- 3 violations - You will have half of your access disabled to services in your account. 

- 4 or 5 violations - Your account is set up for deletion. An email will be sent to you for what services that you are linked to from your MyTT account. You will be able to recover your account after 90 days have passed. If possible, administrators may delete your account data from the service if the account deletion on MyTT doesn’t work. This is only for those that login with the local login system. 

- More than 5 - Your account is deleted, and all accounts that are linked to your MyTT account are also deleted forever. Your account data on other services that you linked to your MyTT account will also be deleted. 

## Section 4: Age requirements 

TTNRT wants to make a safe place for everyone to enjoy when using our services. However, others do not always follow the age requirement. With the addition of the COPRA laws, along with the Michigan State of law, the age requirement for using our services is at least the age of 13 years old. This is mandatory for anyone using our services or willing to sign up of them. If you are not at least 13 years old but signed up to our services, you are violating the terms of use. An administrator may contact you to discontinue use of the selected service you are using. Your account will not be deleted, however, some features that include posting images, sensitive information, or other material can be limited to that user. Those features will be enabled until their 13th birthday.
